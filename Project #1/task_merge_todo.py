Task 5: Merging & Integration
üìå Goal: Combine all sections into a working program.

‚úÖ What to do:
1. Ensure the user input from Task 1 flows into Task 2.
   - The name should be stored and used throughout the program.

2. Pass the user‚Äôs selected menu choices from Task 2 to Task 3.
   - The drink, entr√©e, and dessert choices should be consistent.

3. Ensure Task 3 correctly calculates and formats the receipt.

4. The formatted receipt from Task 3 should be displayed correctly in Task 4.

5. Test the entire program for errors, ensuring all user inputs and outputs work smoothly.

6. As a team, review and refine the final program to ensure clarity and a smooth user experience.
